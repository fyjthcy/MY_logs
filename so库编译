This error usually indicates that you forgot to include some object files or libraries in the linking of the shared library file. 
Make sure you compile both the SWIG wrapper file and your original program into a shared library file. 
Make sure you pass all of the required libraries to the linker.

Sometimes unresolved symbols occur because a wrapper has been created for a function that doesn't actually exist in a library. 
This usually occurs when a header file includes a declaration for a function that was never actually implemented or 
it was removed from a library without updating the header file. 
To fix this, you can either edit the SWIG input file to remove the offending declaration or 
you can use the %ignore directive to ignore the declaration.
